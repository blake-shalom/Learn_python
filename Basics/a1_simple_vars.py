#playing around with comments and variables

#play around with ints

x = 3 
y = 40

print x * y

#play around with strings

x = "3"
y = "40"

print x + y

#try some casting stuff

print (int(x) + int(y))

#and casting to a string

print (str(x) + str(y))

x = 3
y = 15
# and other arithmetic

print (y ** x) #x to the y power
print (y // x) #y floor divided by x as in like every other languages divide
